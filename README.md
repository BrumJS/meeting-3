Meeting 3
Thursday 22 May 2014 will be our next event, running from 7pm-9pm at Whisk HQ (map)

We'll have talks on both PouchDB and how & why you might benchmark your API.

Also note that after much consideration I've created a Brum JS meetup group. This seemed like the best way to get the group advertised amongst the Brum technical community. If you'd like to join, you'll find it [here](http://www.meetup.com/Brum-JS/)
